# heart-disease-prediction-using-machine-learning
A machine learning project that implements and compares several classification algorithms to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on clinical data. This project follows a full data science workflow, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature analysis, model training, and performance evaluation.


Machine Learning algorithms used:

Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)
Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)
K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)
Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
Random Forest (Scikit-learn)
XGBoost (Scikit-learn)
Artificial Neural Network with 1 Hidden layer (Keras)
